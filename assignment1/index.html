        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to was the little code memorisation
          game. I was instantly intrigued by the little emoticon face and the
          fact that the little screen said “press [symbol of alien] to begin”. I
          felt like because of this interaction I ignored a lot of the other
          sections.
          <br />
          <br />
          I also paid attention to the colour scheme of the website as it
          informed a lot of thematic information about what the website may be
          involved with.

          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Definitely the memory game on Mortons side. I found myself playing
          until I finished every level, and then I discovered the difficulty
          meter beside it and found that I played until I couldn't anymore!
          <br />
          <br />
          I also spent a bit of time reading the information regarding the game
          on the information page. It seems like a really cute and fun game.

          4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with

        </h2>
        <p>
          Most common action was repetitively clicking the buttons for the
          memory game in sequences. As you couldnt win the game, you could play
          again on a different difficulty, hence further clicking of the
          buttons.

          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The primary goal seems to be to get viewers interested enough to sign
          up for the games waitlist. Perhaps morton is also a character in the
          game, therefore you can create rapport with the game and its
          characters before being able to play.

      <div id="box6">
        <h2>
          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There is a large text box with scrolling text that reads “enter your
          email” with a sign up button underneath. I believe the website is
          wanting the target demographic of video game enjoyers to sign up for
          the developers early access, which is evidently no longer available on
          the website. It also has a subheading that says “access waiting list”
          Since this is the largest thing on the screen other than Morton’s
          memory game, I believe it to be the primary goal.

          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think you can access it once or twice, but since it is a very simple
          game, i believe users would get a bit bored after maybe 5-10 mins
          depending on the person. Once you have read and signed up to the
          waitlist you have basically completed all of the goals set by the
          website so it is not necessary to access the site again, unless there
          is an update to the game.

        <h2>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think it communicates when you can interact by the available
          playtest. As it currently says inactive, this would lead me to believe
          that there is the possibility for it to become active, so its possible
          there could be additions and updates to the website, however without
          this there is no reason to interact with the website again once you
          expend the attributes.

          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It references the game 'Simon' which is a memory game where you
          remember colours in an order to win, and it gets progressively more
          complicated every round. This mini game on the website has the same
          exact principle, but with little symbols that perhaps reference the
          game they have designed and are intending to advertise on this
          website.

        <p>
          I believe its wanting the user to be inquisitive, and playful. It
          suggests that whilst the game company and their projects are fun and
          entertaining, they also require some thought. It could also could
          reference the fact that their designs are to be enjoyed by all ages.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The references communicate that perhaps this mini game is linked to
          something else that is large and interactive. The reference to 'Simon'
          the memory game suggests that this could be an interactive project
          that requires a bit of thought and perhaps strategy.

        <p>
          The most frustrating part was the fact that I had no idea what this
          websites initial purpose was as there was no real indicators or
          marketing of the game they were promoting. It took me far too long to
          realise that this was indeed promoting a sepereate company and
          creation, not just the mini game on the front page of this website.

        <p>
          I think the most satisfying part of the interaction was winning the
          mini game at the highest level! I also feel like the design was
          incredibly cohesive and told a story that referenced the game
          companies core aesthetic choices and I feel like that it is a
          satisfying match in that regard.
