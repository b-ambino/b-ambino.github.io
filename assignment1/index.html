      <h1>Interactive Experience Research Project</h1>
      <br />

      <h3>
        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      The first thing i paid attention to was the little code memorisation game.
      I was instantly intrigued by the little emoticon face and the fact that
      the little screen said “press [symbol of alien] to begin”.
      <h3>
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Play the little memory game under the morton side</li>
        <li>Sign up for their waitlist</li>
        <li>Toggle sound</li>
        <li>Adjust the memory games difficulty</li>
        <li>
          Click and tear a playtest report out of a little receipt printer
        </li>
        <li>View current playtest which is inactive</li>
        <li>Click the little screen that has gameplay footage</li>
        <li>Turn the console on and off</li>
        <li>Click the information button</li>
        <li>Click the discord link</li>
        <li>Read about their game toggle open answers to questions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>

      Definitely the memory game on Mortons side. I also spent a bit of time
      reading the information regarding the game on the information page. It
      seems like a really cute and fun game.

      <h3>
        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      Most common action was repetitively clicking the buttons for the memory
      game in sequences. As you couldnt win the game, you could play again on a
      different difficulty, hence further clicking of the buttons.
      <h3>
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      The primary goal seems to be to get viewers interested enough to sign up
      for the games waitlist. Perhaps morton is also a character in the game,
      therefore you can create rapport with the game and its characters before
      being able to play.
      <h3>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>

      There is a large text box with scrolling text that reads “enter your
      email” with a sign up button underneath. It also has a subheading that
      says “access waiting list” Since this is the largest thing on the screen
      other than Morton’s memory game, I believe it to be the primary goal.
      <h3>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>

      I think you can access it once or twice, but since it is a very simple
      game, i believe users would get a bit bored after maybe 5-10 mins
      depending on the person. Once you have read and signed up to the waitlist
      you have basically completed all of the goals set by the website so it is
      not necessary to access the site again, unless there is an update to the
      game.

      <h3>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>

      I think it communicates when you can interact by the available playtest.
      As it currently says inactive, this would lead me to believe that there is
      the possibility for it to become active, so its possible there could be
      additions and updates to the website, however without this there is no
      reason to interact with the website again once you expend the attributes.

      <h3>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>

      It references the game that it is advertising, using footage from the game
      and imagery on both pages. It also references the simon memory game but
      with a different design, the symbols are more robotic looking. There is
      also an emoticon that responds to your clicking when playing the memory
      game.

      <h3>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>

      I believe its wanting the user to be inquisitive, and playful. You should
      engage based on touch and what is interesting to you. The game serves as a
      fun starting point for anyone who isnt aware of the game, and then you can
      click around and learn about the game and potentially sign up for the
      waitlist if you feel inclined.

      <h3>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>

      <h3>
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>

      <h3>
        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
