<!-- This is my logic and reasoning for the elements I included in my media player design.

1. I decided that since my media player was designed for focus and meditation, that I 
would keep the design simple and without many distractions. I had the main audio player
be the focus so the design was front and center, whilst having the added ambience buttons 
below as an addition for the user. 

2. I decided that since I was only able to use one audio, I would have a play/pause, 
volume and mute buttons. This makes the UI simple for the user and ensures the design isnt too 
overwhelming. 

3. The ambient buttons are an addition for the user so they're able to add meditative sounds 
to the main audio. I decided that from my own experience that using ambience like rain sounds 
when studying along with music which is why I felt like adding this option would improve the 
media player. 

4. I also decided to add a subheading of motivational words. I know in class I was given some code
to create a randomiser with an array but I could not figure out how to get it to work and I 
tried really hard to! But I felt like I should try honour the idea the best I could so I added them
as a subheading. -->
